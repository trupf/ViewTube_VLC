ViewTube_VLC
============

This patch is made to improve performance of the ViewTube userscript from Sebaro 
(http://isebaro.com/viewtube/) in firefox.
It is specially aimed at use with the VLC plugin but should not break compatibiliy with other plugins
and probably improve totem performance the same way as VLCs (not tested by me).

Fixes:

- remove the 'Alt' option and decide browser dependent instead
- make VLC work with Vimeo without delay in Firefox
