Installation
============

You should first install the Viewtube script from Sebaro either from 

http://greasefire.userscripts.org/scripts/show/87011

or from

http://isebaro.com/viewtube/

It will install a script file in a subdirectory 

<your firefox profile>/gm_scripts/ViewTube

Just replace the installed ...user.js file with the new one and give it the same name as the old file.

If you have the patch command installed you could alternatively use the patch (which by chance will also
apply without errors to newer versions of the original ViewTube). Put the patch in the same directory as
original and apply it with 

patch file_to_patch < viewtube_20130410_vlc_performance.patch

e.g.

patch 87011.user.js < viewtube_2013-04-10_vlc_performance.patch

or

patch viewtube-2013-04-10.user.js < viewtube_2013-04-10_vlc_performance.patch

After applying the patch you may delete the patch file (if no errors occured...).
